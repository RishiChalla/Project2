"Notes: This table indicates whether each state has a policy to mandate that some or all employers use E-Verify, an electronic verification system that confirms the employment eligibility of workers. Most states with this mandate require either public employers  and state contractors, or all employers with at least a certain number of employees, to use E-Verify.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We note the date that a bill was signed into law, not the implementation date. More information on these policies is available in the ""E-Verify Policies"" tab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
