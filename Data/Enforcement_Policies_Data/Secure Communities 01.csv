"Note: This table indicates whether each state was participating in Secure Communities in each year. The dates here represent the Secure Communities ""activation date,"" as reported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Some jurisdictions in each state may have signed a Secure Communities agreement earlier than this date, or may have had Secure Communities become active later than the date reported for the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secure Communities is a federal data-sharing program that ran from 2008 to 2014 and was reinstated in January 2017. State participation was initially voluntary but later became mandatory and was active in all states by 2012. Through Secure Communities, fingerprints submitted by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI are shared with immigration enforcement agencies for checks against immigration databases. Depending on the result, immigration officials decide whether to take enforcement action, like issuing a detainer request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
