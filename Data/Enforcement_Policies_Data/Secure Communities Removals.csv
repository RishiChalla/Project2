Note: This table shows the number of people removed through the Secure Communities program from each state in each year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fiscal year (FY) 2015 data only show removals through February 2015, that is, they only show data for the first five months of the fiscal year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Removals"" are the expulsion of a noncitizen from the United States because of a violation of immigration law and criminal law.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Data on removals through Secure Communities were first reported for FY 2009. Secure Communities ended in FY 2015, so we do not include 2016 in this table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secure Communities is a federal data-sharing program that ran from 2008 to 2014 and was reinstated in January 2017. State participation was initially voluntary but later became mandatory and was active in all states by 2012. Through Secure Communities, fingerprints submitted by local law enforcement agencies to the FBI are shared with immigration enforcement agencies for checks against immigration databases. Depending on the result, immigration officials decide whether to take enforcement action, like issuing a detainer request.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
