Notes: This table indicates whether each state or some or all of the counties in the state with the highest immigrant population had a policy to not honor some or all Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests. These are written requests to local jails and law enforcement agencies asking that they hold individuals for an additional 48 hours after their release date to give ICE time to process the case and decide whether to take the individual into federal custody for removal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Common policies include only honoring detainer requests accompanied by a judicial order or arrest warrant, or refusing to honor all ICE detainers. Some localities do not honor ICE detainers because local courts have ruled such detainers to violate the Constitution or to exceed ICE's authority. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We define counties with the highest immigrant population as those with the largest numbers of foreign-born individuals, counting all counties whose foreign-born population, collectively, totals 50 percent of the overall foreign-born population in the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
