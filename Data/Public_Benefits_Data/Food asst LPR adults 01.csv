Notes: This table indicates whether each state funds food stamps or SNAP-like food assistance for low-income LPRs during their first five years with this status. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key Terms:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LPR = lawful permanent resident ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SNAP = Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
