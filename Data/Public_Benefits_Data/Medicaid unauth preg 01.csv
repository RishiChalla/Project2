"Notes: This table indicates whether each state provides prenatal care, regardless of a woman’s status, through either a state-funded program or through a 2002 CHIP option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
