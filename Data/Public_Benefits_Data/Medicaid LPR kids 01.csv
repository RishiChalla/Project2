"Note: This table indicates whether each state provides public health insurance to LPR children during their first five years with this status. Until 2009, some states provided insurance with state funds. A 2009 law allowed states to use federal matching funds to provide Medicaid or CHIP to LPR children during their first five years with that status. This table shows both states that used federal matching funds and states that offered purely state-funded insurance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LPR = lawful permanent resident ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
