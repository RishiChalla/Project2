Notes: This table indicates whether each state funds public health insurance for adults who are ineligible for public health insurance due to their immigration status.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
