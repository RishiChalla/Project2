Notes: This table indicates whether each state funded public health insurance for children who were ineligible for federally funded public health insurance because of their immigration status.  Some of these programs offer more comprehensive health insurance coverage than others. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
