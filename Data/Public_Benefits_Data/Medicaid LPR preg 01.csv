"Notes: This table shows whether each state provided prenatal care to LPR pregnant women during their first five years with this status. Until 2002, this care was provided with state funds. Regulations issued in 2002 allowed states to fund limited prenatal care for new LPRs through a CHIP option; a 2009 law allowed states to fund some more-comprehensive health coverage to lawfully residing pregnant women through Medicaid/CHIP.   ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lawfully residing means the person is lawfully present in the United States and meets the Medicaid state residency requirement. Lawfully present immigrants include “qualified” immigrants and individuals paroled into the United States for less than a year; with a valid nonimmigrant status (e.g., citizens of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau, and survivors of serious crimes cooperating with law enforcement in prosecuting the perpetrators); granted withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture, temporary protected status, deferred enforced departure, deferred action; family unity, or temporary resident status; with approved visa petition who have filed an application to adjust to lawful permanent residence; granted employment authorization based on application for asylum or withholding of removal (or, if under 14, application pending for over 180 days), temporary protected status, registry, legalization under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, adjustment under the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, suspension of deportation/cancellation of removal, or based on an order of supervision; and children who have applied for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
