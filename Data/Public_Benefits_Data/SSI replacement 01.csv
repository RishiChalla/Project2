"Notes: This table indicates whether each state offers cash assistance at levels close to those received under SSI to LPRs who are ineligible for SSI even after five years with this status. SSI supports seniors and people with disabilities, including children, who have very little or no income.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In New Hampshire, qualified immigrants are eligible for state-funded SSI after a five-year bar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Much of this information came from the National Immigration Law Center, which collected information as it came to them and did not always conduct a “50 state check” when they updated the tables. Sometimes their revisions represent a correction rather than a new program or the elimination of a program.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Key Terms:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LPR = lawful permanent resident ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SSI = Supplemental Security Income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
