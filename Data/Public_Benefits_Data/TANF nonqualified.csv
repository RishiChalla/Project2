Key terms:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"""Qualified” immigrants – = (1) lawful permanent residents (LPRs); (2) refugees, asylees, persons granted withholding of deportation/removal, conditional entry (in effect before Apr. 1, 1980), or paroled into the United States for at least one year; (3) Cuban/Haitian entrants; (4) battered spouses and children with a pending or approved (a) self-petition for an immigrant visa, (b) immigrant visa filed for a spouse or child by a US citizen or LPR, or (c) application for cancellation of removal/suspension of deportation, whose need for benefits has a substantial connection to the battery or cruelty (parent/child of such battered child/spouse is also “qualified”); and (5) survivors of trafficking and their derivative beneficiaries who have obtained a T visa or whose application for a T visa sets forth a prima facie case. (A broader group of trafficking survivors who are certified by or receive an eligibility letter from the Office of Refugee Resettlement are eligible for benefits funded or administered by federal agencies, without regard to their immigration status.) ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"“PRUCOL” = permanently residing in the United States under color of law. This is not an immigration status, but a benefit eligibility category. The term generally means that immigration authorities are aware of a person’s presence but have no plans to deport/remove him or her from the country. It is interpreted differently, depending on the benefit program and jurisdiction. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
