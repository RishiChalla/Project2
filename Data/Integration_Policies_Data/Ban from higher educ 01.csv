Notes: This table indicates whether each state denies enrollment at its public colleges and universities to unauthorized immigrant students.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Georgia’s State Board of Regents passed rules regulating the admission of undocumented students in 2010, stating that any institution that has not admitted all academically qualified applicants in the two most recent years is not allowed to enroll undocumented students. This affected the most-competitive public universities in the state.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Alabama, DACA recipients may enroll at selected universities and community colleges, but other unauthorized immigrant students may not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In South Carolina, DACA recipients may enroll in any public colleges or universities, but other unauthorized immigrant students may not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
